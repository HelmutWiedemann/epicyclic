# Epicyclic Server - a portable AJAX portlet container

epicyclic (from epicyclic gear) is a portable portlet container (JSR 286) built with gatein, intended to run on a lightweight webcontainer (currently tomcat 7 as target runtime).
Together with a lean ReST controller to the portlet container and a javascript library (built with jQuery), the portlets can be integrated in any webpage.
